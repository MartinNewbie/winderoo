# Bill of Materials & Cost

## Things I've assumed you already own
- Computer + USB cables
    - The instructions should be interchangable across all common operating systems (Windows / macOS / Linux)
- 3D printer
- How to use a multimeter
- How to solder and de-solder
- Some spare small-gauge wire (ex. 22 AWG)
- Rudimentary knowledge of electronics

## Required parts
The following parts list will allow you to build:
- 1x powered winder (required)
- 2x unpowered winders (optional)

This means that you'll be able to construct a 3-watch winder. Remember that the system is modular, so if you only build a single powered winder, that's also ok.

- The following tables contain affiliate links to Aliexpress; **you do not pay an inflated price because of this.**
- Any supplier is OK to use (Aliexpress or otherwise), so long as you buy what's outlined in the table(s) beneath.
