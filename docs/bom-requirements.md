# Bill of Materials & Cost

## Things I've assumed you already own
- A computer + USB cables
    - The instructions should be interchangable across all operating systems
- A 3D printer
- How to use a multimeter
- How to solder and de-solder
- Some spare small-gauge wire (ex. 22 AWG)
- Rudimentary knowledge of electronics

## Required parts
The following parts list will allow you to build:
- 1x powered winder (required)
- 2x unpowered winders (optional)

This means that you'll be able to construct a 3-watch winder. Remember that the system is modular, so if you only build a single powered winder, that's also ok.

### Total cost of Parts
> $65.00 (January 2023)

- The Following table contains some affiliate links to Aliexpress; you **do not** pay an inflated price because of this.
- Aliexpress was chosen as it is the most accessible 'one-stop-shop' for all users.
