# Printing Recommendations
* These are general priting recommendations, please remember that you know your printer better than I!

## General Advice
1. The following models will require support:
    * `STRUCT_mid-plate`
    * `watch-mount`
1. The model is designed to be printed with PLA, therefore tolerances are spec'd for that
    * Tolerances are between `0.1 - 0.2mm`
1. Print with 25% infill
    * This will the increase overall rigidity of the model, especially when dealing with the motor's torque.
    * This will also give you a "premium feeling" product.
1. [If your printer has a tendency elephant foot](https://pick3dprinter.com/elephant-foot-3d-printing/), you'll need to file down some of the pieces.
    * For example, the `mounting-dowel`'s outter lip will need to be filed down so the `mounting-dowel-collar` can easily slip over it.

## Recommended Printing Orientation by Model
- Total time spent printing is 24 hours per winding unit
