## Watch Jig Assembly

> :warning: This assembly may require epoxy glue and sandpaper/filing. The driveshaft assembly is a tight, friction fit, and must be centered inside the jigâ€™s bore.

### Required parts:
- ***4mm rod***
- `watch_jig` model
- `watch_jig_collar` model
- `watch_jig_driveshaft` model

### Steps:
1. Cut the ***4mm rod*** to 110mm in length, then de-burr the ends with a file or sandpaper.
1. Test fit the `watch_jig` and `watch_jig_collar`. They should begin to push together by hand. If your printer is dialed in, these two parts will be a tight friction fit. Flip the assembly upside down and rest the collar against a flat surface. Place your thumbs overtop of the center of the `watch_jig` and push down. The `watch_jig_collar` should drive itself into the `watch_jig`â€™s body. 
    - If the `watch_jig` and `watch_jig_collar` donâ€™t fit together, lightly sand/file the lip of the `watch_jig_collar` until it fits inside the `watch_jig`â€™s bore.

    <div>
1. Test fit the ***4mm rod*** and `watch_jig_driveshaft` model. Again this will be a tight fit, but the rod should be able to move through the `watch_jig_driveshaft`â€™s bore with a twisting motion; hold the `watch_jig_driveshaft` and twist/push the metal rod through the bore. If this isnâ€™t possible, file the `watch_jig_driveshaft`â€™s inner bore to fit.

    <div>
1. **Read the next step in full before you begin!** 
1. Do a partial test fit  of the driveshaft/rod assembly and the jig/collar assembly. The driveshaft assembly should start to drive into the collar's bore with the same twist/push motion you used to drive the metal rod through the driveshaft. **DO NOT FULLY SEAT THE ASSEMBLIES YET**. Now do the following:
    - Remove the driveshaft assembly from the jig assembly again
    - Move the `watch_jig_driveshaft` to halfway down the ***4mm Rod***, like so
        <div align="center"><img src="images/watch_jig_assembly/assembled_driveshaft+rod.jpg" alt="assembled rod + driveshaft" height="300"></div>
    - Apply a drop of ***epoxy glue*** inside the `watch_jig_collar`'s bore with something small (ex. toothpick). Make sure the epoxy is at the bottom.
        <div align="center"><img src="images/watch_jig_assembly/collar_glue.jpg" alt="where to glue in collar" height="300"></div>
    - Take the driveshaft and jig assemblies in your hands; align the metal rod in the center of the `watch_jig_collar`'s bore. This should self-center. Place the jig assembly upside down on a flat surface and *gently* push the `watch_jig_driveshaft` down the bore until it fully seats. Pick up the complete assembly and verify that the driveshaft is vertically aligned and the assembly rotates true. Leave the assembly upside down (driveshaft points to the sky) and allow the epoxy to dry.

## Tensioner Assembly

### Required parts:
- 1x ***608ZZ bearing***
- `tensioner_pulley` model
- `tensioner_pulley_mount` model

> :warning: This assembly may require epoxy glue and sandpaper/filing. The outter pulley and inner pulley mount should be a tight friction fit. However, not all 608ZZ bearings are made equal and may require a touch of glue to secure the models to the bearing.

### Steps:
1. Test fit the `tensioner_pulley` and ***608ZZ bearing***; these should should press-fit together. If they do not, lightly sand/file the inner bore of the `tensioner_pulley` until it begins to fit over the bearing. Drive the pulley down the bearing until the bearing and pulley faces are flush.
    <div align="center">
        <img src="images/tensioner_assembly/pulley+bearing.jpg" alt="tensioner pulley partial fit over 608ZZ bearing" height="300">  
        <img src="images/tensioner_assembly/pulley+bearing_assembled.jpg" alt="tensioner pulley and bearing flushed" height="300">  
    <div>
1. Test fit the bearing's center race overtop of the `tensioner_pulley_mount`; these should should press-fit together. If they do not, lightly sand/file the mounting peg of the `tensioner_pulley_mount` until the bearing begins to fit. Drive the bearing down the tensioner's mounting peg until the bearing and peg's faces are flush.
    <div align="center"><img src="images/tensioner_assembly/tensioner_assembled.jpg" alt="tensioner assembled" height="300"><div>
1. The bearing's **center** should not be loose or rotate around the mounting peg. If it does, apply a small drip of epoxy to the peg's base. If you find it difficult to tell, hold the tensioner mount in one hand and rotate the pulley. If you can feel any kind of vibration, you need to apply glue. If the bearing is a tight fit, you should feel no vibration.

## Mounting Dowel Assembly

> :warning: You must create 4 of these assemblies

> :warning: This assembly may require sandpaper/filing. The fitment between the `mounting_dowel` and `mounting_dowel_sleeve` is a tight friction fit.

### Required parts per assembly:
- 2x ***M3 Heat Set Nuts***
- `mounting_dowel` model
- `mounting_dowel_sleeve` model

1. Setup your soldering iron. We'll need it to insert our heat set nuts into each dowel end.
1. While your soldering iron is heating up, test fit the `mounting_dowel` and `mounting_dowel_sleeve`. They should begin to push together by hand. If your printer is dialed in, these two parts will be a tight friction fit. Flip the assembly upside down so that the open end of the `mounting_dowel_sleeve` is resting on a flat surface. Gently push down on the `mounting_dowel` until it slides into place and the face of the dowel and sleeve are flush.
    <div align="center">
        <img src="images/watch_jig_assembly/1.jpg" alt="" height="300">  
        <img src="images/watch_jig_assembly/2.jpg" alt="" height="300"> 
        <img src="images/watch_jig_assembly/3.jpg" alt="" height="300"> 
    <div>
1. **Read the next step in full before you begin!** 
1. Take your dowel assembly and one ***heat set nut***. Place the nut on the end of the dowel and make sure it's sitting straight. Take your _hot_ soldering iron and hold it against the nut. After a few seconds the nut should beging to melt into the dowel. Try to get it as straight as can be, and make sure the nut's face is flush with the end of the dowel. If it's gone 'too deep,' or crooked, hold your soldering iron against the nut until it is free to move inside the bore and re-adjust as necessary. It does not need to be perfect. Repeat the same step for the other end of the dowel.
    <div align="center">
        <img src="images/watch_jig_assembly/1.jpg" alt="" height="300">  
        <img src="images/watch_jig_assembly/2.jpg" alt="" height="300"> 
        <img src="images/watch_jig_assembly/3.jpg" alt="" height="300"> 
    <div>
1. Repeat all these steps for each dowel assembly. By the end, you should have 4 completed assemblies.

## Central Support Bearings

### Required parts:
- 2x ***608ZZ Bearings***
- `STRUCT_mid_plate` model
- `STRUCT_back_plate` model

1. Lay the `STRUCT_back_plate` on a flat surface, then lay a ***608ZZ bearing*** overtop of the center housing of each plate.

1. Gently tap the bearing down until it sits level and flush inside the center housing.
