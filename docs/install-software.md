# Software Installtion & Flashing your ESP32
> This guide covers setup for the hardware API.

### Have you completed the Prerequisites?
- No? [See here](./prereqs.md)

# Getting Started

## Flashing your microcontroller

1. Download this repository. You can do this via git or by downloading the repository as a ZIP.
    - If you downloaded the repository as a zip, uzip it before proceeding to step 2.

1. Open the extracted folder (or cloned repository if using git) in Visual Studio Code
1. Select 'PlatformIO' (alien/insect looking button) on the workspace menu and wait for visual studio code to finish initializing the project
    <div align="center"><img src="images/platformIO.png" alt="platformIO button"></div>
1. Expand the main heading: **"esp32doit-devkit-v1"**:
    <div align="center"><img src="images/platformio_project_menu.png" alt="platformIO actions overview"></div>
1. Expand the "General" heading, then click **Upload**. You'll see a message if the code was uploaded successfully:
    <div align="center"><img src="images/code_uploaded.png" alt="code upload button"></div>
1. Now expand the "Platform" heading, then click **Upload Filesystem Image**. You'll see a message if the code was uploaded successfully:
    <div align="center"><img src="images/code_uploaded.png" alt="upload filesystem button"></div>
1. All done! Your microcontroller should now have 2 LEDs illuminated. If it does, proceed to [Next steps](#next-steps). If not, try to upload the code & file system again.

## Next steps:

Ok, you've got 2 LEDs illuminated on your board. Great! Let's make sure the code works.

1. Get out your mobile device (phone/table) and navigate to the Wi-Fi / wireless network list. You'll want to find and join a WiFi network called "**Winderoo Setup**."
    - it may take a minute or so to connect, or look like it isn't doing anything. Hold tight, it is.
1. Once you've connected to "**Winderoo Setup**", a captive page will open called "WifiManger Winderoo Setup."
1. Tap "Configure WiFi"
1. Tap on the network you want to add Winderoo to, this is likely your home WiFi network
1. Enter your WiFi network's password then tap "Save." Wait until the captive page closes itself.
1. Re-join your home WiFi network
1. Open up a web browser and try to navigate to the following webpage:
    - [http://winderoo.local/](http://winderoo.local/)
1. If you see Winderoo's user interface, you're all done!
